# Chatbox
End-of-Year project, Reti di Calcolatori, 2017/18

Simple chat client with hybrid architecture, using both a server and p2p connections, and allowing account creation, 
contacts integration and file sharing.
Specific aspects of this client's implementation, such the use of a certain technology or protocol, or the decision 
not to encrypt anything or require any form of account authentication were part of the original requirements.
